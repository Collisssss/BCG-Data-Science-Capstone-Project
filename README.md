• Completed a customer churn analysis simulation, identifying essential client data and outlining a strategic investigation approach.

• Preprocess data for final modeling, including column dropping, removing outliers and feature engineering (used dummy variable and one hot encodingtransform categorical to numerical variables). Employed data visualization for trend interpretation

• Completed the engineering and optimization of a random forest model, achieving an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn. Optimized models by gradient boosting. Validated model effectiveness by plotting ROC curves

• Determined the classification-based algorithm (Logistic Regression, Support Vector machine, KNN, Random Forest, XGB, Gradient boosting, LGBM, CatBoost) for predictive modeling. Performed cross validation to improve their performance
